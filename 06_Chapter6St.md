# Chapter 6: Strategic Voting and Blindsides

*In this chapter, we will dive into the world of strategic voting and blindsides in Survivor. These are two essential tactics that can make or break your game. Joining us as a special guest for this chapter is none other than the legendary Survivor winner, Parvati Shallow.*

Survivor is a game where a single vote can change everything. By masterfully playing with the dynamics of the tribe, voting strategically can make a huge impact on the game. In this chapter, we will learn how to use voting as a weapon, and how to make sure our vote counts.

But just voting at the right time may not always be enough. Sometimes you need to strike from behind the scenes. That's where blindsides come in. Blindsides occur when a player is eliminated from the game without knowing it was coming. These can be devastating to the player, and they often happen due to clever strategy and deception from the opposing tribe.

To help us understand these tactics, we've invited Parvati Shallow, one of the most strategic and cunning players in Survivor history. She will share her experience and knowledge with us, giving us an insight into how she used strategic voting and blindsides to win Survivor.

On top of discussing these strategies, we'll also explore when it may be a good time to implement them, and how to avoid them being used against us. By the end of this chapter, you'll be a voting and blindsiding pro, ready to take on any challenge the game throws your way.

*Fun fact: Did you know that Parvati Shallow is considered the queen of Survivor blindsides, having masterminded multiple throughout her career?*

So join us as we venture into the world of strategic voting and blindsides, and prepare to be amazed by the tactics and skills necessary to win Survivor.
# The Tale of the Strategic Blindside

Once upon a time, on a remote island in the South Pacific, a new season of Survivor was beginning. A group of castaways from different walks of life found themselves stranded, ready to fight for the ultimate prize.

One of these castaways was a cunning strategist, named Parvati. She knew that in order to win, she needed to be willing to make bold moves, including blindsiding her fellow players.

As the game progressed, Parvati found herself in a tight alliance with two other players. They were dominating the game, winning challenges and controlling the tribe. But as the merge approached, tensions began to rise within the group.

Parvati knew that in order to keep her alliance in power, she needed to start making moves. She began to plant seeds of doubt within the minds of the other players, using her strategic prowess to turn them against each other.

When it came time for the next Tribal Council, Parvati knew that a blindside was necessary to keep her alliance in control. She convinced the rest of the tribe to vote off one of their own, blindsiding them all and securing a powerful position for her alliance.

The game continued, and Parvati continued to make strategic moves, using her voting power and blindsiding abilities to outmaneuver her opponents. In the end, her alliance emerged victorious, and Parvati was crowned the winner of Survivor.

As Parvati reflects on her game-winning strategy, she emphasizes the importance of strategic voting and blindsides. By being willing to make bold moves, and by anticipating the moves of her fellow players, she was able to gain control of the game and secure her place in Survivor history.

And so, the lesson is clear: in order to win Survivor, one must be ready to make strategic moves, including voting strategically and blindsiding their opponents. By mastering these tactics, one can secure power in the game and emerge victorious, just as Parvati did.
