# Chapter 9: Playing the Jury, Understanding the Minds of the Eliminated Players

*When the game of Survivor reaches its final stages, only a handful of castaways remain. At this point, each castaway is well aware that they must make bold moves or be left empty-handed; but in doing so, they must also avoid alienating the jurors or risk surrendering the million-dollar prizing to another castaway.*

*To win Survivor, it is crucial that you understand the minds of the other eliminated players and use this knowledge to your advantage. The jury, made up of these players, ultimately decides who wins and who doesn't. Thus, their opinions and impressions of each castaway become paramount to your success.*

*In this chapter, we'll take a deep dive into playing the jury, starting from the moment you are voted out to the final FTC (Final Tribal Council) and beyond. We will examine how the jury perceives each player's game, how they make their decisions, and what influences their votes. By understanding the motivations, biases, and perceptions of each juror, you can craft better arguments, back-up your claims, and adapt your strategy to the preferences of the jury.*

*So, let's set our sights on the end game and learn how to win the greatest game on earth!*

If you haven't read that chapter yet, we strongly recommend doing so before diving into this one.* 

*As the game progresses, the stakes get higher, alliances are tested, and the social dynamics of the contestants become increasingly complex.

# Chapter 9: Playing the Jury, Understanding the Minds of the Eliminated Players

## The Tale of Robin Survivor

Once upon a time, in a far-off land called Survivoria, there was a skilled and cunning castaway known as Robin Survivor. Robin had been playing the game for 37 days and was now in the final three. She knew that winning the final competition was critical, but she also knew she had to convince the jury that she deserved to win.

Robin had played an impressive game up to this point, lasting through multiple tribals and making several strategic moves. But she also knew that just having a good game wasn't enough. She had to connect with the eliminated players and show them why she was the most deserving of the million-dollar prize.

As Robin stood before the jury, she knew she had to employ some critical strategies to win their votes. She had to show humility, acknowledge the successes of the other finalists, and demonstrate how her game was more substantial than those of her competitors.

She started by reflecting back to the moments when she was voted out. She reminded the jury that at the time, it had felt like the end of the world. But then, she found new strength and determination, knowing she had to earn her way back into the game. She talked about the moment she won her way back by winning a challenge and how emotional that moment was for her.

Robin continued to build her case, showing how each of her moves throughout the game was a calculated risk based on the information she had gathered. She explained how her choice of alliances ensured her game was both strategic and social.

By this time, the jury was attentive, and Robin knew it was time to reel them in finally. She ended her FTC statement by acknowledging that the choice of who to vote for was a difficult one. She then asked the jury to vote for her but only if they would be proud to call her the Sole Survivor.

After Tribal Council, Robin and the other finalists eagerly awaited the votes. As the host Jeff read out the eight jury votes, Robin's name was called up six times, and she had won by a landslide! Robin was over the moon with such a resounding victory, and she knew that her understanding of the minds of the eliminated players had given her the winning edge.

## Resolution

Robin's success was not just about her strategy and social game. Instead, it had much to do with her understanding of the jury, their motivations, and their preferences. Voting is primarily driven by personal feelings, and Robin knew how to connect with each juror.

This chapter has highlighted that knowledge of human behavior, persuasion, and argumentation is critical to playing Survivor at any stage. The information offers an opportunity to win a game that rewards both strategy and personal relationships.

By crafting a compelling final statement, acknowledging the big moves of fellow castaways, and being convincing in their words, Robin was able to win over the jury, and subsequent votes.
In conclusion, playing the jury in Survivor is a critical step in securing victory in the game. To win, you must have a solid understanding of the jurors' biases, motivations, and perceptions of the finalists, and use this knowledge to your advantage.

Remember, the jurors are not just looking for the most strategic player or the best at challenges. They often vote based on personal feelings, who connected with them emotionally, or who they believe played the most ethical game. Thus, it is essential to build strong relationships with other castaways throughout the game, maintain humility and acknowledge others' achievements.

By employing the strategies discussed in this chapter and connecting with the jurors on an emotional level, you will improve your chances of winning.
 
Survivor is an intricate game with many twists and turns, but by understanding the minds of the eliminated players, a player can keep their strategy in check and emerge as the Sole Survivor.
